# Episode 5 : Shaders implementation in C++ from thinmatrix java code (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w7lNF8dnYw&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP&index=5)
Added shaders implementation
Note : Shaders were present in my previous directories (episode-2 and episode-3) but that wasn't clean and it was basically because otherwise it doesn't work on linux
